    "### Purpose of this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Many national datasets are updated annually with survey results from the previous year. The \"Treatment Episode Admissions Data Set\" (TEDS-A) is one such example. This survey is updated anually to provide data on admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities. It is backed by state laws, requiring collection and reporting of data from all publically-funded facilities. It also includes some data from privately funded facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the yearly data is sometimes merged with previous years, there is often a delay in the preparation of the combined datasets. The merged datasets also include all variables from all years, which can result in unwieldy file sizes. Rather than wait for the data to be merged by the managing organization, and to avoid battling with data wrangling as much as possible, this workflow focuses on automating the process in order to produce a curated dataset and associated models based on selected variables and informed user imput (business objective).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this workflow is tailored to the TEDS-A data and will run through a standard selection of data science processes as follows (outline of steps): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merge previous years with the most current data release, \n",
    "2. Select desired variables and drop all others, \n",
    "3. Conduct standard pre-processing procedures (including imputation and feature engineering), \n",
    "4. Generate descriptive and visual analyses of the data (exploratory data analysis), \n",
    "5. Conduct modelling, \n",
    "6. Evaluation and model selection, and \n",
    "7. Export (and deploy) the data and models. \n",
    "\n",
    "These objectives will be acomplished from mostly a data science point of view rather than a statistical one. Although some model assumptions and diagnostics will be observed, the overall purpose is to predict an outcome with the greatest accuracy achieveable while still maintaining a research point of view regarding variable parsimony. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this workflow has two critical assumptions of its own: 1) the TEDS-A dataset(s) are based on surveys that are generally the same with few changes year-to-year (note that diagnosis criteria may change); 2) the user has a basic understanding of the dataset from the available documentation and has a pre-determined question. The user will be required to supply the separate datasets for merging as well as the variables of interest. For further simplification, the user will also be queried for input on data wrangling and other steps. The result will be a curated dataset and models tailored to the needs of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example use of this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the power and utility of this workflow, I have selected a particular research question that I would like to explore in the TEDS-A dataset (research/academic objective). I am aware that the TEDS-A dataset includes information on  patients' mental health status based on diagnosis using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Accordingly, I would like to determine whether the variables in this dataset, and particularly patterns and types of drugs used and arrest, can accurately predict certain mental health diagnoses. Building models to help facilitate medical diagnosis, or at least the appropriation of medical services, is an important task for further improving our ability to manage the well-being of a growing population (Cho, Yim, Choi, Ko, & Lee, 2019)."

This type of inconsistency (i.e. gaps in the data across years) can quickly result in the inability to conduct meaningful analyses. Although the workflow incorporates a brief reminder, it largely assumes the user is attempting to merge datasets that have at least some non-demographic variables in common.\n",

For the time being and simplicity's sake, the workflow currently allows a maximum of five separate data files to be merged. We will be using three separate data files since years 2015-2017 of TEDS-A collected data on the same variables. This will also allow demonstration of how to merge less than five datasets.\n",

This indicates that interaction terms among sociodemographic variables may reveal additional details within the data. It is also possible that interactions of sociodemographics with other variables in the data may reveal hidden interactions that explain more nuance of the data.\n",

    "As part of this evaluation, we visually explore the model's predictive capabilities by using a visual confusion matrix. As we can see, the model does an excellent job of classifying the \"reference\" category. This is expected since the number of observations in this aggregate category is far greater than the other two we selected. However, the model still does an okay job of identifying the others. Providing more data and conducting a more rigourus hyperparameter tuning process, would no doubt improve the capabilities of this model."
